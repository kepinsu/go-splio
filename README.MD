# Go Splio

This is the Golang Splio non-official SDK built.

## Documentation

Please to see [The Splio API Referance](https://dev-scp.splio.com/reference) 

## Some Notes

Splio's HTTP API is very messy and has multiple versions thus we have done our best to keep it simple and work around
it. Please read the source code to see examples of this.

## Testing

You will need to use environment variables to test everything.

## Contributing Notes

 * You must have tests.
 * Keep it simple.
